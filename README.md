# fwupdater

- It is a program that transmits the firmware image through ymodem.
It contains a simple communication protocol required before firmware transmission.
The GUI used the tkinter library.
- This is a toy project created at the request of a close friend.
I learned Python for the first time through this project, and I was interested in Python.
